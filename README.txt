The initial experts files contain the information of the number of experts, followed by the number of alternatives, with the set of preference matrices representing each expert (separated by a blank line)

The results have been grouped in folders by number of experts and alternatives. Each xlsx file shows the results grouped by the distance to the initial experts, having fixed the consensus similarity (the last part of the file name). The format of the results are groups of the 3 different replacement methods, each of them showing the distance to the experts and the consensus obtained as pairs of lines. We show in the first two lines the best front of the seed of the GA, then the best front of iteration 25, and finally the best front after the full execution. We show all the possible combinations of selection, crossover, mutation and replacement.

The graphs on the right of the xlsx files show the comparison between the replacement methods having fixed the same selection, crossover and mutation methods corresponding to the left side of the data file. At the bottom of the file (line 200) we show the comparison of the different combinations of selection, crossover and mutation methods, having fixed the NSGA replacement after the full execution.
